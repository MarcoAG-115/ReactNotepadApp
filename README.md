## Description

A Native React application that has been primarily developed to work on mobile devices, specifically the latest iPhone models (12,13, & 14). The Notepad app takes the framework of a basic note app and adds calculator functionality. Aside from creating, searching, & editing notes, users can type out numeric equations to see the results. The calculator functionality is limited to mostly arithmitic operations (/, *, +, -, %, ^).
The following characters & phrases can be used:
Addition
```bash
5+5
5 plus 5
```
Subtraction
```bash
4-1
4 minus 1
```
Multiplication
```bash
4*4
4 times 4
```
Division
```bash
10/2
10 divided by 2
```
Exponential
```bash
2^3
```
Remainder / mod
```bash
6 mod 3
```
 The application will follow the standard order of operations (PEMDAS). Additionally, the app will keep track of a total sum at the bottom of each note. This sum is calculated by using all the numbers displayed on the right side of the notepad text area. The app can be downloaded as an iPhone app if it is ran through Xcode, but it can also work as a web app.

## Frameworks

The foundation of this application is mainly sourced by bootstrapping Create React App (Native React). Some of the original code for the note functionality is sourced from a tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3ooazcK4TI). Otherwise, the UI/UX design and the majority of the functionality are proprietary.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
